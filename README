GitHub Copilot: # automation.py

This script is used for automating the process of splitting a scanned PDF file into multiple PDF files based on the information provided in an Excel CSV file.

## Dependencies

- os
- shutil
- pandas
- PyPDF2

## How it works

1. The script first asks for the name of the scanned PDF file and the Excel CSV file.
2. It reads the scanned PDF file and the Excel CSV file.
3. It creates a new PDF file for each page in the scanned PDF file.
4. It reads the 'Names' and 'Page Num' columns from the Excel CSV file.
5. It checks if the total number of pages in the scanned PDF file matches the total 'Page Num' in the Excel CSV file.
6. If they match, it merges the appropriate number of PDF files based on the 'Page Num' and saves them with the corresponding 'Names' from the Excel CSV file.
7. It then moves the newly created PDF files to a 'Scans' directory.

## Usage

Run the script and provide the names of the scanned PDF file and the Excel CSV file when prompted.

```bash
python automation.py
```

## Note

- The scanned PDF file and the Excel CSV file should be in the same directory as the script.
- The 'Scans' directory should also be in the same directory as the script.
- The 'Names' column in the Excel CSV file should contain the names for the new PDF files.
- The 'Page Num' column in the Excel CSV file should contain the number of pages for each new PDF file.
